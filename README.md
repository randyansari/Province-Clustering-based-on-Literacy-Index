# Province-Clustering-based-on-Literacy-Index
This is the Capstone Project that I did when I joined the Generasi GIGIH 2.0 program by Yayasan Anak Bangsa Bisa and GoTo Group. This project aims to implement the skills of Data Analysts obtained in classes such as SQL, Python, Statistics, and DataViz on real-world problems. In this project, our group chose the topic of problems in the field of education, especially related to reading interest in Indonesia. We cluster the reading interest level of Indonesian people based on their province, where out of 34 (in 2021) provinces in Indonesia are grouped into two clusters. The first cluster consists of 29 provinces and the second cluster consists of 5 provinces, where each cluster has its own problems related to how to foster people's interest in reading.

This is the DataViz:
